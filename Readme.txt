## GETTING INTO THE PROJECT:
WEB-Based Smart Health Management System 

 This system has a ‘Home’ page from where the a visitor can see what we are offering.
 This system also has a ‘Login’ Users and administrator can login into their accounts by toggling the tabs accordingly.

‘Contact’ page allows users to provide feedback or queries about the services of the hospital. Fig 1.3 shows the ‘Contact’ page.

The ‘Login’ page consists of 3 modules:
1. User Module

### User Module:

This module allows User to create their account, to store their health mesurement data, see their mesurement history and also their progress.
The registration page asks User to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Contact Number, Password and radio buttons to select their gender.

Once the User has created his/her own account after clicking the ‘Register’ button, then he will be redirected to his/her Dashboard
